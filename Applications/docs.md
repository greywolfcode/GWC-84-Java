# GWC-84 Java Applications

Applications are custom Menus that can be used to extend functionality of your console calculator.

The .java files should be placed in the Applications folder.

The class should extend Menus.Menu as found in other menus in this program.

Note that Applications are not checked before they are run; only install applications from trusted sources.
This is why .java and not .class files are used: You can read and check them before use.
