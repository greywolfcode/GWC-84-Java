# GWC-84 Java Applications

Applications are custom Menus that can be used to extend functionality of the terminal calculator.

The .java files should be placed in the Applications folder.

The class should extend Menus.Menu as found in other places in this program.

Note that Applications are not chcked before they are run; only install applications from trusted sources.
This is why .java and not .class files are used: You can read and check them befor use.
